For my 4th project I built a website for Bermondsey and Rotherhithe Children’s Centres. The website is primarily for parents to view timetables of events that are happening at the different children’s centres. There is also the facility using JWT for secure logins for admins to login and to change details in the timetables and to add any news about the children’s centres. The website also has a Google map for each children’s centre with a marker with the address and a mail to facility for parent’s to contact the children’s centre.

### Tech
AngularJS, Google maps API, Mongoose, CSS, Bootstrap, Trello, Marvel, Node, Express, and JWT
